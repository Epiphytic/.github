# ☁️ Epiphytic
### Software that lives on the air.
e·pi·phyt·ic (adj): Relating to a plant that grows on another plant but is not parasitic, deriving its moisture and nutrients from the air, rain, and physical debris around it.

## The Philosophy
We build software that rejects the soil. Epiphytic is a home for diverse projects designed to "float" around the web, decoupling themselves from deep roots and heavy infrastructure.

Traditional software relies on the "ground"—monolithic servers, hard-coded dependencies, and static environments. Our projects are different. They adhere to the "canopy" of the modern web—living on edges, inside containers, or atop existing platforms—thriving in conditions where other applications cannot survive.

## The Ecosystem
This organization collects tools that share a unique architectural biology:

Rootless (The "Floating" Principle) Our code is portable by nature. It does not require a specific "soil" (OS or hardware) to grow. It is designed to drift between clouds, settle on edge devices, or float in serverless environments, needing only a surface to anchor to.

Non-Parasitic We build Epiphytic Assistance Systems. Our tools may live on top of other platforms (the "host"), but they do not harm them. They enhance, extend, and decorate the host ecosystem without extracting resources or creating tight coupling.

Efficient Absorption Just as epiphytes survive on mist and dust, our projects require minimal resources. They are designed to extract high-value signal (water) from the noise of the web, growing beautifully even in "data deserts" or low-power environments.

## The Collection
We are a greenhouse for the experimental and the resilient:

Drifters: Lightweight agents that float across distributed networks.

Climbers: Overlays that ascend existing UI/UX to add new utility.

Blooms: Visualizations that generate beauty from sparse data streams.
